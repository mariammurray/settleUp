## Overview

**settleUp** is an interactive (just for fun) betting platform built with React, designed as a capstone project during a coding bootcamp.

The app allows users to:

- Create and share private "betting rooms" where users can invite friends to see each otherâ€™s bets in real-time using Socket.IO.
